# üßë‚Äçüíª Code repository 
Code I have created as part of projects mostly related to Physics. See below for a list explaining details about the code included in this repository.

### Z<sub>0</sub> boson
Code to find best mass, width and lifetime of the Z<sub>0</sub> boson, by minsimising chi-square. Use of Scipy to minimise the function, Matplotlib to create graphs and Meshgrid to create contour plots. \

### Dice game#
Code which allows two players to roll dice. Writes data to file, storing account information so users can log in and compare their scores on a leaderboard. Note that this code was written as part of my GCSE and so there are errors. I will update the code soon to fix this. \
