# üßë‚Äçüíª Code repository 
Code I have created as part of projects mostly related to Physics. See below for a list explaining details about the code included in this repository.

### Dice game
Code which allows two players to roll dice. Writes data to file, storing account information so users can log in and compare their scores on a leaderboard. Please note that this was written very early in my coding career, and I have become aware of errors which I aim to fix soon. \

### Virial coeficients via Monte Carlo
Calculates the B_3 and B_4 virial coeficients via Monte Carlo integration. Compares to known values. \

### Z<sub>0</sub> boson
Code to find best mass, width and lifetime of the Z<sub>0</sub> boson, by minsimising chi-square. Use of Scipy to minimise the function, Matplotlib to create graphs and Meshgrid to create contour plots. \
