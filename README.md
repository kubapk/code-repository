# 🧑‍💻 Code repository 
Code I have created as part of projects mostly related to Physics. See below for a list explaining details about the code included in this repository.

### Z<sub>0</sub> boson
[Open Code](Z_0 boson/zboson.py) \
Code to find best mass, width and lifetime of the Z<sub>0</sub> boson, by minsimising chi-square. Use of Scipy to minimise the function, Matplotlib to create graphs and Meshgrid to create contour plots.
